# Description
I created this project for a few reasons. I wanted to be able to take the skills I have already learned and build 
upon them. This gave me multiple opportunities to go back and re-learn content and discover new ways of doing things. 
Secondly, I want to have a place to showcase these skills im learning to potential employers. 

## Installation
This website really stretched me in terms of what I know. Formatting the website was a challenge for me, so I
began to use absolute formatting. This gave me a lot more control over where my content was going. 
I also installed a gray scale hover effect to make the images pop when you put your mouse over them. These were two
challenging yet rewarding aspects of this project. 

## Usage
I hope this website will be built upon, and accessible to future potential employers. It will be a great place to continue building 
and storing projects. 


## Credits
I have to credit the information we have been using in class. I also spent a lot of time researching and reading 
various coding sites as I got stuck or ran into issues.
